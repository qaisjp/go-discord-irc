**Is this being maintained?** Yes. But I want to merge all this functionality into the much superior [matterbridge by 42wim](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge).

This is IRC to Discord bridge was originally built for [@compsoc-edinburgh](http://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh) and
[ImaginaryNet](http://imaginarynet.uk/), but now it looks like more people are using it!

- The `IRC -> Discord` side of things work as you would expect it to: messages on IRC send to Discord as the bot user,
as per usual.
- The `Discord -> IRC` side of things is a little different. On connect, this bot will join the server with the `~d`,
and spawn additional connections for each online person in the Discord.
- Supports bidirectional PMs. (Not user friendly, but it works.)


**Features**

(not a full list)

- When a Discord user's presence is "offline" or "idle", their irc puppet will have their AWAY status set.
- A Discord user offline for will disconnect from IRC after 24 hours (or whatever `cooldown_duration` you set).
- Join/Quit/Part/Kick messages are sent to Discord (configurable)

## Gotchas

Things to keep in mind in terms of functionality:

- This does not work with private Discord channels properly (all discord users are added to the channel)
- **DO NOT USE THE SAME DISCORD BOT (API KEY) ACROSS MULTIPLE GUILDS (SERVERS).**

It's built with configuration in mind, but may need a little bit of tweaking for it to work for you:

- **Hardcoded**: Hostnames are hardcoded to follow the IPv6 IPs listed [here](https://github.com/qaisjp/go-discord-irc/issues/2).
- **Defaults aren't usable**: You should set the `suffix` and `separator` config options. The default options require custom modifications to the IRC server.
- **Server config**: This uses `WEBIRC` to give Discord users on IRC a distinct hostname. [See here](https://kiwiirc.com/docs/webirc).

## Configuration

The binary takes three flags:

- `--config filename.yaml`: to pass along a configuration file containing things like passwords and channel options
- `--simple`: to only spawn one connection (the listener will send across messages from Discord) instead of a connection per online Discord user
- `--debug`: provide this flag to print extra debug info. Setting this flag to false (or not providing this flag) will take the value from the config file instead
- `--insecure`: used to skip TLS verification (false = use value from settings)
- `--no-tls`: turns off TLS

The config file is a yaml formatted file with the following fields:

- `discord_token`, [the bot user token](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
- `irc_server`, IRC server address
- `irc_pass`, optional password for connecting to the IRC server
- `channel_mappings`, a dict with irc channel as key (prefixed with `#`) and Discord channel ID as value
- `suffix`, appended to each Discord user's nickname when they are connected to IRC. If set to `_d2`, if the name will be `bob_d2`
- `separator`, used in fallback situations. If set to `-`, the **fallback name** will be like `bob-7247_d2` (where `7247` is the discord user's discriminator, and `_d2` is the suffix)
- `irc_listener_name`, the name of the irc listener
- `guild_id`, the Discord guild (server) id
- `webirc_pass`, optional, but recommended for regular (non-simple) usage. this must be obtained by the IRC sysops
- `debug`, debug mode
- `insecure`, TLS will skip verification (but still uses TLS)
- `no_tls`, turns off TLS
- `webhook_prefix`, a prefix for webhooks, so we know which ones to keep and which ones to delete
- `nickserv_identify`, optional, on connect this message will be sent: `PRIVMSG nickserv IDENTIFY <value>`, you can provide both a username and password if your ircd supports it
- `cooldown_duration`, optional, default 86400 (24 hours), time in seconds for a discord user to be offline before it's puppet disconnects from irc
- `show_joinquit`, optional, default true, displays JOIN, PART, QUIT, KICK on discord
- `max_nick_length`, optional, default 30, Maximum allowed nick length

**The filename.yaml file is continuously read from and many changes will automatically update on the bridge. This means you can add or remove channels without restarting the bot.**

An example configuration file (those marked as `requires restart` definitely require restart, but others may not currently be configured to automatically update):

```
discord_token: abc.def.ghi
irc_server: localhost:6697
guild_id: 315277951597936640
nickserv_identify: password123

# Updating this will automatically add or remove puppets from channels
channel_mappings:
  "#bottest chanKey": 316038111811600387
  "#bottest2": 318327329044561920

suffix: "_d2"
separator: "_"
irc_listener_name: "_d2"
webirc_pass: abcdef.ghijk.lmnop

show_joinquit: true # displays JOIN, PART, QUIT, KICK on discord
cooldown_duration: 86400 # optional, default 86400 (24 hours), time in seconds for a discord user to be offline before it's puppet disconnects from irc

# You definitely should restart the bridge after changing these:
insecure: true
no_tls: false
debug: false
webhook_prefix: "(auto-test)"
#simple: true
```

This bot needs permissions to manage webhooks as it creates webhooks on the go.

```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>&scope=bot&permissions=0x20000000
```

**NEW IN 2020**

Make sure you also give the bot application these intents too:

## Docker

First edit `config.yml` file to your needs.
Then launch `docker build -t go-discord-irc .` in the repository root folder.
And then `docker run -d go-discord-irc` to run the bot in background.
